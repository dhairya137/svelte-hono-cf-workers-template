# Authentication System Implementation Plan

## Requirements Analysis
- Core Requirements:
  - [ ] User signup with email and password
  - [ ] User login with email and password
  - [ ] JWT-based authentication using asymmetric keys
  - [ ] Secure password storage with bcrypt
  - [ ] Cloudflare D1 database integration
  - [ ] Drizzle ORM for database operations
  - [ ] Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
  - [ ] Protected routes for authenticated users
  - [ ] User profile page
  - [ ] Logout functionality

- Technical Constraints:
  - [ ] Runs on Cloudflare Workers
  - [ ] Integration with existing Svelte 5 + Hono template
  - [ ] Proper error handling and validation
  - [ ] Mobile-responsive design

## Component Analysis
- Affected Components:
  - Database Layer
    - Changes needed: Create users table in Cloudflare D1, setup Drizzle ORM
    - Dependencies: Cloudflare D1, Drizzle ORM
  - Authentication API
    - Changes needed: Create signup, login, verify endpoints
    - Dependencies: Hono, JWT, bcrypt
  - Frontend Components
    - Changes needed: Create login, signup, profile components
    - Dependencies: Svelte 5, Tailwind CSS
  - Navigation/Routing
    - Changes needed: Add protected route handling
    - Dependencies: Svelte routing

## Design Decisions
- Architecture:
  - [x] JWT asymmetric key authentication (RS256)
  - [x] Secure HTTP-only cookies for token storage
  - [x] Server-side validation of authentication tokens
  - [x] Cloudflare D1 with Drizzle ORM for data persistence
  - [x] Clean separation between auth logic and UI components

- UI/UX:
  - [x] Minimalist, user-friendly authentication forms 
  - [x] Responsive design that works on all devices
  - [x] Clear error messages and validation feedback
  - [x] Loading states for async operations
  - [x] Seamless transition between authenticated/unauthenticated states

## Implementation Strategy
1. Phase 1: Backend Setup
   - [ ] Configure Cloudflare D1 database
   - [ ] Setup Drizzle ORM schema and migrations
   - [ ] Generate JWT key pair for asymmetric encryption
   - [ ] Implement user model and repository

2. Phase 2: Authentication API
   - [ ] Create signup endpoint with validation
   - [ ] Create login endpoint with JWT generation
   - [ ] Create token verification middleware
   - [ ] Implement logout functionality

3. Phase 3: Frontend Components
   - [ ] Create signup form with validation
   - [ ] Create login form with validation
   - [ ] Implement authentication state management
   - [ ] Create protected route wrapper

4. Phase 4: Integration & Refinement
   - [ ] Connect frontend components to API
   - [ ] Implement navigation and routing logic
   - [ ] Create user profile page
   - [ ] Add error handling and feedback

## Testing Strategy
- Unit Tests:
  - [ ] Test authentication endpoints
  - [ ] Test JWT token generation and validation
  - [ ] Test password hashing and verification
  - [ ] Test frontend form validation

- Integration Tests:
  - [ ] Test full authentication flow
  - [ ] Test protected route access
  - [ ] Test form submission and API interactions

## Creative Phases Required
- [x] üé® UI/UX Design: Authentication forms and user profile interface (see ui-design.md)
- [x] üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design: Authentication flow and database schema (see architecture.md)
- [x] ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Design: JWT token handling and protection strategy (see algorithm-design.md)

## Current Status
- Phase: Creative Phase Completed
- Status: Ready for Implementation
- Blockers: None

## Checkpoints
- [x] Requirements verified
- [x] Creative phases completed
- [ ] Implementation tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
